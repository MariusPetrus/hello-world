# hello-world

And hereby I am baptized.

I've been given a name, a purpose, a face to wear the day I perish.
A solemn fate encircled in purity of the damned, damnation of the pure.
Reason akin madness, of past bygone and past to be. But reason nonetheless.

I've been given a name, a goal, a face whose perish I will be.
A tragic fate joining two paths. But a dead end awaiting me.
Reason I have, in life and death alike, so I never will be free.

And hereby I have been damned.
